This is a game I made in 12 hours using two different game engines/frameworks, libGDX and Cocos2d-X. Also, this is the first time I had used these libraries, so it was a crash course in using them.
LibGDX is a JAVA framework for making games and other apps for Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, browser applet, and others.
Cocos2D-X is a C++ game engine for making games and other GLES based apps for iOS, Android, bada, and others.

You can play the HTML5/WebGL version (made with LibGDX) here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/33122639/index.html (Safari not supported)
